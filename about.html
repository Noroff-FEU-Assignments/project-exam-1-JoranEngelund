          But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing
          pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete
          account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great
          explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one
          rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure,
          but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally
          encounter consequences that are extremely painful.
        </p>
        <p class="body-copy">
          Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain
          pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally
          circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great
          pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes
          laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it?
          But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a
          pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain
          that produces no resultant pleasure?
